A Phishing-detection application

In today's world, the threat of a cyber attack can't be ignored. There are a plethora of companies that try to protect their customers from potential damage, such as getting infected by a virus, getting ransomware or malware, protect their business intelligence and so on.

This thesis is concerned with another part of the cybercrime called phishing. Phishing is a social engineering attack to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, bank account credentials for malicious reasons. Because of a large attack vector, there isn't a reliable way/tool to prevent such an attack.

This thesis will review several ways to detect a phishing attack, implement some of them and test them in the production environment with an association with a Trusted Network Solutions company. The final software could be easily used with another proxy or tool.

 Possible ways of detecting a phishing attack are:
A: detection approaches:
- user training approaches
- software classification approaches
B: offensive defense approaches:
- BogusBiter (browser toolbar which submits fake information in HTML forms)
- Humboldt - similar to BogusBiter
C: correction approaches - after detection, an action is taken by service providers:
- websites
- e-mail
- social networks
- a public switched telephone network/VoIP
D: prevention approaches
- Law Enforcement Agencies

Phishing detection by blacklists:
- Google Safe Browsing API
- DNS-Based blacklist
- PhisNet: Predictive Blacklisting
- Automated Individual White-List

Phishing detection by Heuristics:
- SpoofGuard
- Collaborative Intrusion Detection
- PhishGuard: A browser Plug-In
- PhishWish: A Stateless Phishing Filter Using Minimal Rules
- CANTINA: A content-Based approach
- A phishing sites blacklist generator

Phishing detection by visual similarity:
- Classification with discriminative keypoint features
- visual similarity-based detection without victim site information

Phishing detection by data mining:
- Automatic Detection of Phishing Target from Phishing webpage
- Detecting DNS-poisoning-based phishing attacks from their network performance characteristics
- Textual and Visual Content-Based Anti-Phishing: A Bayesian Approach
- Detecting Phishing Emails Using Hybrid Features
- Large-Scale Automatic Classification of Pages

Title:

Phishing detection system based on URL testing

Description:

The goal of this master's thesis is to design and implement a system,
which will compute potential risk for a given URL. The computation of
potentional risk is based on extendable series of individual tests suites and the result
of weighted tests is number called 'phishing score'. Based on this number, application can automatically
allow or block this communication. Optionally, the end user could be warned and
decide if he wants to proceed to this website.

The source for tests should be this following work:

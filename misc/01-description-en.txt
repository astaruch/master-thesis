Title:

Phishing detection system based on URL testing

Description:

The goal of this master's thesis is to design and implement a system,
which will compute potential risk for a given URL. The computation of
potential risk is based on extendable series of individual test suites,
and the result of weighted tests is a number called 'phishing score'.
Based on this number, the application can automatically allow or block
the given communication. Optionally, the end user could be warned and
decide if he wants to proceed to this website.


The source for tests should be this following work:
